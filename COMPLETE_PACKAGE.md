## 🎬 **Video Demo Script**

### **Opening (0:00-0:15)**
"Hi, I'm [Name] from Restaurant-IQ. Today I'll show you how restaurant owners are increasing margins by 5-15% using data they already have."

### **Problem (0:15-0:45)**
"Most restaurants track costs in spreadsheets. Time-consuming. Error-prone. And still, you don't know which menu items actually make money after delivery platform fees and VAT."

### **Solution Intro (0:45-1:00)**
"Restaurant-IQ solves this. One platform. All your cost data. Real-time insights. Let me show you."

### **Dashboard Tour (1:00-1:30)**
"This is The Golden Fork's dashboard. £84k revenue, 29% margin, £24k profit. Every number is clickable. Watch..." [Click cost slice, show drill-down]

### **Menu Costing (1:30-2:15)**
"Menu costing: Your Grilled Sea Bass costs £6.23 in ingredients. Sells for £18.50. That's £12.27 gross profit. But wait - VAT. Output VAT £3.08, input VAT £1.25, net VAT £1.84. All automatic."

### **Supplier Risk (2:15-2:45)**
"Supplier risk tracking. Your salmon supplier raised prices 15% last month. You're 70% dependent on them. Time to diversify. Restaurant-IQ catches this automatically."

### **What-If Simulator (2:45-3:15)**
"The game-changer: What-if simulator. What if you raise prices 5%? Move the slider... £4,200 extra profit. What if food costs drop 2%? Another £1,680. Now you can decide with confidence."

### **Closing (3:15-3:30)**
"Most customers see ROI in 2-4 weeks. 14-day free trial, no credit card. Want to see this with your data? Link in description."
