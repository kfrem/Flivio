## 🎤 **Demo Script (5 Minutes)**

### **Minute 1: The Problem**
"How much did you make last week? Most restaurant owners can't answer this accurately. You're managing hundreds of costs, suppliers, menu items - all in spreadsheets or your head."

### **Minute 2: The Dashboard**
"Here's The Golden Fork, a demo restaurant. At a glance: £84k revenue, 29% margin, £24k profit. Click any number - instant drill-down. See exactly where money flows."

### **Minute 3: Cost Intelligence**
"Menu costing: Your Grilled Sea Bass costs £6.23, sells for £18.50, gives you £12.27 profit. But wait - output VAT is £3.08, input VAT is £1.25, net VAT payable is £1.84. Automatic."

### **Minute 4: Supplier Risk**
"Your salmon comes from one supplier. Price went up 15% - flagged automatically. Plus, you're 70% dependent on them. Time to diversify."

### **Minute 5: The Game Changer**
"What if you raise prices 5%? Move the slider - instantly see £4,200 extra profit. What if food costs drop 2%? Another £1,680. Now you can decide with confidence."

```
Subject: Losing £500+/month to hidden costs?

Hi [Name],

Quick question: Do you know exactly how much your best-selling dish actually costs you (including VAT)?

Most restaurant owners don't. And that's costing them £500-£2,000 per month in hidden leakage.

Restaurant-IQ shows you:
• Exact cost & profit per dish (with VAT breakdown)
• Which suppliers are quietly raising prices
• What happens if you change prices before you do it

The Golden Fork in Shoreditch increased their margins by 7% in the first month.

Want to see how much you could save?
